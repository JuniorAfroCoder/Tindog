# Tindog
Tindog is a Tinder "parody" developped as a challenge in completion of a bootcamp challenge.
The website has been coded with HTML, CSS and Bootstrap. 
Images were furnished as course resources. Logos are from Font Awesome.

The live version can be found at https://juniorafrocoder.github.io/tindog
